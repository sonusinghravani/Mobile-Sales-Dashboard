## 🎯 Business Problem

A mobile phone retailer needed to understand its sales performance across brands, cities, payment methods, and time periods. Key questions were:

- What’s the total sales and how is it growing?  
- Which cities, brands, and models drive the most revenue?  
- How do customers pay? (UPI, Card, Cash)  
- Are sales better than last year?  

This dashboard was built using real sales data provided by **Career247** to turn raw numbers into actionable insights for smarter business decisions.

## 📊 Dashboard Goal

The goal is to help sales managers, marketing teams, and executives:

- Track daily, monthly, quarterly, and yearly sales trends  
- Compare current performance with last year (“Same Period Last Year”)  
- See which cities, brands, and models sell the most  
- Understand customer behavior (payment methods, ratings)  
- Make data-driven decisions on inventory, promotions, and pricing

## 🔍 Interactive Features: Filters & Comparisons

I added powerful filters for:

- **Mobile Model**  
- **Payment Method**  
- **Brand**  
- **Year, Quarter, Month, Day**

Also included a **“Same Period Last Year” toggle** — so users can instantly compare this year’s sales with last year’s.

> ✅ *Why this matters?*  
It helps spot growth or decline quickly. For example, if sales dropped in July vs last year — you can investigate why and fix it.

## 📄 Purpose and Description

This dashboard was created as part of my training at **Satish Dhawale**. The dataset includes 769M+ sales, 19K+ units, 4K+ transactions across 50+ cities and 100+ mobile models.

I cleaned and prepared the data using **Power Query**, created calculated metrics in DAX, and built interactive features like **filters, drill-downs, and “Same Period Last Year” comparison** — so managers can make smart decisions fast.

The dashboard tells a clear story: **sales are growing, customers prefer UPI, and certain brands/cities are driving results**. With the right tools, we can turn data into profit.

This project reflects my skills in:
